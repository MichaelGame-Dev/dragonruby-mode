# Project Contract — dragonruby-mode

## 1. Purpose (Propósito)
This project exists to help developers understand DragonRuby while writing code in Emacs, by reducing cognitive load, preserving mental context, and increasing the developer’s agency over their tools.

This project prioritizes understanding over automation.

## 2. Core Philosophy
The editor is not just a text editor.
It is a cognitive amplifier.

At scale, small frictions compound.
Seconds lost repeatedly become minutes of lost focus.
Minutes become fatigue.
Fatigue becomes disengagement.

This project exists to resist that erosion.

The goal is not speed of typing, but clarity of thought.

## 3. Guiding Influences
This project is inspired by long-term editor design principles articulated by Amir Rajan:
- Developer agency over tools
- Transparency over magic
- Extensibility as survival
- Tools that grow with the mind, not replace it

---

## 4. What This Project DOES
- Explains DragonRuby concepts in-context while coding.
- Makes implicit engine concepts explicit and visible.
- Provides live, non-intrusive explanations.
- Encourages learning through exposure and repetition.
- Preserves the user’s control and understanding.
- Is designed for long-term use and maintainability.

## 5. What This Project DOES NOT Do
- It does not generate game code automatically.
- It does not hide DragonRuby’s complexity.
- It does not enforce workflows or patterns.
- It does not replace official documentation.
- It does not attempt to be an IDE or a game engine.
- It does not trade clarity for convenience.

## 6. Non-Negotiable Principles
- Everything must be readable.
- Everything must be traceable.
- Everything must be inspectable.
- Everything must be extensible by the user.
- No feature may obscure how DragonRuby actually works.
- No feature may increase cognitive load.
- No feature may introduce repeated micro-friction.
- Simplicity is preferred over cleverness.
- Stability is preferred over novelty.

---

## 7. Cognitive Time Principle
A feature that saves seconds but breaks mental flow is a failure.

Cognitive continuity is more valuable than raw speed.
Preserving context is more important than adding shortcuts.

---

## 8. Career-Aware Design
This project respects that developers evolve over time.

It must support:
- exploration when learning
- exploitation when mastery is reached

The tool must never force relearning in order to remain productive.

## 9. Design Rules
- Features are expressed as concepts, not magic behaviors.
- Explanations are executable code, not static text.
- Presentation must be non-intrusive.
- The system must be modular and layered.
- No single file may grow beyond clear responsibility.

## 10. Rules for Contributors (Human)
- If a feature does not help the user think more clearly, it does not belong.
- If a feature cannot be explained simply, it is not ready.
- If a feature removes agency, it is rejected.

## 11. Rules for Contributors (AI)
Any AI-generated contribution must:
- Preserve all existing concepts.
- Avoid introducing opaque abstractions.
- Maintain separation between:
    - concept
    - explanation
    - presentation
- Prefer explicitness over automation.
- Respect backward compatibility.

## 12. Evolution Policy
- The project evolves by adding concepts, not convenience.
- Capabilities must remain composable.
- Backward compatibility is a priority.
- Refactoring is allowed only if clarity improves.

## 13. Success Criteria
This project is successful if:
- Users consult external documentation less often.
- Users understand their own DragonRuby code better.
- Users feel increased control, not dependence.
- The tool fades into the background during flow.

## 14. Long-Term Vision
This project is intended to remain useful for decades.

Code should be boring, explicit, and durable.
The editor should grow with the developer — not replace them.
